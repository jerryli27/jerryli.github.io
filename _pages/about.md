<!-- what do I want to get across? help people box me by giving a brief overview of my career. career interest and what I've done.  -->

I am a Research Engineer at Google DeepMind. **My research focuses on real time interactive agents**: AI agents that are situated with the user, react to streaming audio-visual inputs, and proactively help the user achieve their goals. I am fortuate to have worked closely with [Matt Botvinick](http://mattbotvinick.com/), [Greg Wayne](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Greg-Wayne/89504302), [Dilan Gorur](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NwaIVdUAAAAJ&hl=en) and many others on this.

Here are some related research questions that I'm interested in: How to build a foundation model that understands and operates in real-time? How to make RLHF work for real-time interactions? How to work around the memory constraints for long-term video understanding and for a more personalized agent? What enables an agent to learn on the fly? 

Previously, I worked on Offline RL and RL for commercial cooling systems with [Cosmin Paduraru](https://sites.google.com/site/cosminpaduraru) and [Daniel Mankowitz](https://danielmankowitz.wixsite.com/danielm). I was also very interested in style transfer for both images and audio, back when GANs, VAEs, and cycle consistency methods were popular. For audio, I collaborated with [Jesse Engel](https://research.google/people/JesseEngel/) and [RJ Skerry-Ryan](https://research.google/people/RJSkerryRyan/). I briefly worked on [AlphaFold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) commercial applications in drug discovery. Before DeepMind, I was part of the Natural Language Understanding team of Google Assistant. For my undergrad and Master's, I worked with [Doug Downey](https://allenai.org/team) on word-vector-based NLP research.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading ([my book recommendations](https://jerrylijiaming.com/books/)), [Kitesurfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiteboarding), playing guitar, binge-watching shows, and learning new languages. My names in non-Latin languages are: 李 嘉銘 · リ　ジェリー. I used to be addicted to video games.
